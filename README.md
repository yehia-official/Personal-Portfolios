## 💼 Monthly Progress

Just hit my monthly goal!  
I finished **9 Front-End portfolio projects** and pushed them all to GitHub 💻🔥

Throughout the journey, I explored multiple UI styles using **Tailwind CSS** — including **landing pages**, **dashboards**, and more.  
Each project was a unique challenge, and I learned a lot along the way!
